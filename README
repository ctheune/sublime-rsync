A sublime 2 plugin to keep your project environment in sync with a remote host.

When investigating an option to use sublime for editing Puppet code that needs
to live on a remote server I wasn't satisfied with the performance of the SFTP
plugin: we have a big code base with many, many files and I basically just
wanted to trigger rsync when saving.

So this plugin currently doesn't do much more than calling rsync for you when saving a file.

In your project's file you can configure it like this::

    {
        "folders":
        [
      {
         "path": "."
     }
     ],
     "settings": {
        "rsync-source": "/local/path/to/my/code/",
        "rsync-target": "host:/remote/path/to/my/code"
        }
    }
